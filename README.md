# DS Assignment | Churn Prediction

## About The Data
Attached is a [random sample data](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_Q01kvVn_V_3fUbt-NkPg2I5kPME2_OfnTaJLzd8qXY/edit#gid=1447522361), which contains multiple fields about users:

- customer ID is ID of a customer
- TargetID is whether he churned in next 2 months or not
- variable containing X in its name is indicative of spend on some goods
- other variables are mostly self explanatory
- you can use your logic to create new  variables
- if a variable name ends with \_m0, it means this variable is for last 30 days if it ends with \_m1, it means, this is for last 31 to 60 days period, if it ends with \_m3, it means this is for last 61 to 90 days period


What Is expected

Develop churn model with given data

1. Create a ML model to predict customers, who will churn
1. Document using jupyter notebook
1. Focus on all the relevant steps of model building
1. Keep the code clean, modular and properly committed
1. Share the notebook and csv having userID and predicted targetid from the [validation data](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18UV53pcF1qsQiKv2oeNMhT6U_86ilhQ2ycZNkC4aPR0/edit#gid=1477112248) within two days from now.
1. The final model will be assessed on F1 score on validation data.
